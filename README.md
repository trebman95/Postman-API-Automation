# Postman: API Automation

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I will walkthrough my API automation process using Postman to set up collections for organized API requests, using environment variables for flexibility, and writing test scripts to validate responses. I chain requests to simulate real-world workflows and conduct data-driven testing with external files to cover multiple test cases. I automated test execution by integrating Postman with CI/CD pipelines via Newman, ensuring continuous testing and quality monitoring. Detailed reports and notifications help track issues, while Postmanâ€™s collaboration tools allow for seamless teamwork and version control throughout the development lifecycle.

Created a checklist for the app's main functionality, focusing on accessing the user's account and tracking daily user activity. Then, I conducted a Smoke Test with the intent of creating bug tickets in Jira if any checks failed: <br/>

<br />
Start Regression testing by executing up to 60 test cases across other test cases that we created from my team and corrected any of my test cases that were in the "Retest" status from my team :  <br/>
